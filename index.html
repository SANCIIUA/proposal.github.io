    <h1>Proposal:</h1>
    <p>Proposal:  

        Out of all our assignments this quarter, I found myself enjoying our work with the therapy chat bot the most, so I decided that I’d be working with that. I noticed with the <br> therapy bot that I was not exactly liking how it interacted with the human participant i.e. being quite clunky and inflexible, so no matter what type of chatbot I make, <br> I want the language and interaction to be much more fluid. So that would mean having a much more extensive list of potential dialogues with more precise rules that are 
        <br> less likely to misfire and not connect to whatever the human user is saying. Compared to the Eliza bot and my own “therapy” bot that I made; I want the look of the site  <br> to be much more refined. 
        <br><br>
        From that, I had two main ideas for what type of chat bot I am going to be making. The first and what I am leaning towards is that I want to make a friend bot that users can <br> chat to. The idea is on its head, simple, but I want it to have such extensive and precise dialogue that many users will feel ,hey are speaking to a real person. <br> Something that the author of the Eliza bot said can happen. If the user talks about their feelings, the bot will be able to understand and relate, if they talk about their <br> hobbies, work, relationships, the bot will be able to respond as a friend would and even offer its own advice and “experiences”. My second idea for the bot would be to <br> make it more of a tertiary device for an existing website. I was thinking that I would make fake, either business or medical website, and included in the website would <br> be a FAQ bot that is there to answer any questions that the user may have.  <br><br><br>
